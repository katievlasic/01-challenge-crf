# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

There is an on-the-job ticket with the emphasis on accessibility. This means there is existing code that needs to be refactored so it adheres to the 'customers' standards to make their site more accesible.

I'll demonstate the "Scout Rule" so the initial code will be left a little cleaner upon completion. 

Please access the final application at [Github Pages - This Repository](https://katievlasic.github.io/01-challenge-crf/).
