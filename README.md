# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

There is an on-the-job ticket with the emphasis on accessibility. This means there is existing code that needs to be refactored so it adhere's to the 'customers' standards to make their site more accesible.

I'll demonstate the "Scout Rule" so the initial code will be left a little cleaner upon completion. 

For now, the elements on the site aren't responsive on the site so viewing the resolution is smaller than 768px.

This challenge will be assessed by:
- Technical Acceptance
- Deployment
- Application Quality
- Repository Quality
